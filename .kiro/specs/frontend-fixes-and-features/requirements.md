# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical frontend rendering issues and missing functionality across all user panels (Admin, Ops, Checker) in the Laravel/Vue.js Airbnb concierge application. The system currently has incomplete frontend views, broken signature workflows, missing dummy data, and inconsistent user experiences. This spec will systematically fix rendering issues, implement missing features, enhance the signature workflow for checkers, and populate the system with comprehensive dummy data to showcase all functionality.

2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and functionality across all views
3. WHEN data is missing or loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states and fallback content
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
5. IF components fail to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and show alternative content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Admin user, I want a fully functional admin panel with all features working correctly, so that I can manage the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display accurate statistics, recent missions, and checker management tools
2. WHEN an Admin manages contract templates THEN the system SHALL allow creating, editing, signing, and activating templates with proper validation
3. WHEN an Admin views analytics THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive charts, performance metrics, and exportable reports
4. WHEN an Admin manages users THEN the system SHALL allow creating, editing, and assigning roles to Ops and Checker users
5. WHEN an Admin views system logs THEN the system SHALL display incident reports, audit trails, and system health metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Ops user, I want a complete operational dashboard with kanban board, calendar integration, and bail mobilité management, so that I can efficiently manage all operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Ops user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a functional kanban board with drag-and-drop capabilities for bail mobilité status management
2. WHEN an Ops user creates a bail mobilité THEN the system SHALL automatically generate entry and exit missions with proper scheduling
3. WHEN an Ops user assigns checkers THEN the system SHALL send notifications and update mission status appropriately
4. WHEN an Ops user validates checklists THEN the system SHALL display all submitted photos, signatures, and allow approval/rejection with comments
5. WHEN an Ops user views the calendar THEN the system SHALL display all missions with filtering, creation, and editing capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Checker user, I want a complete mobile-friendly interface with working signature functionality, so that I can efficiently complete missions and sign contracts on-site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Checker accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display assigned missions, completion statistics, and quick action buttons
2. WHEN a Checker views a mission THEN the system SHALL display all relevant information including property details, checklist items, and signature requirements
3. WHEN a Checker completes a checklist THEN the system SHALL allow photo uploads, condition selections, and notes with proper validation
4. WHEN a Checker needs to sign a contract THEN the system SHALL display a signature pad that captures finger/stylus input and generates a signed PDF
5. WHEN a Checker submits a completed mission THEN the system SHALL notify the Ops team and update the mission status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Checker user, I want to sign bail mobilité contracts using my finger on a touch device, so that I can complete the legal documentation process on-site with tenants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Checker clicks "Sign Here" on a checklist or contract THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen signature pad optimized for touch input
2. WHEN a Checker draws a signature THEN the system SHALL capture the signature data with proper stroke smoothing and pressure sensitivity
3. WHEN a signature is completed THEN the system SHALL allow the Checker to review, clear, or confirm the signature before submission
4. WHEN a signature is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate a PDF contract with both the admin's pre-signature and the tenant's signature with timestamps
5. WHEN the PDF is generated THEN the system SHALL store it securely and make it available for download by Ops and Admin users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer/tester, I want comprehensive dummy data across all features, so that I can evaluate system functionality and identify missing or broken features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN dummy data is created THEN the system SHALL include bail mobilités in all status states (assigned, in_progress, completed, incident)
3. WHEN dummy missions are created THEN the system SHALL include both entry and exit missions with realistic scheduling and assignments
4. WHEN dummy checklists are created THEN the system SHALL include completed checklists with photos, signatures, and various condition states
5. WHEN dummy contracts are created THEN the system SHALL include signed contracts with both admin and tenant signatures for testing

### Requirement 7

3. WHEN viewing dashboards on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts to make efficient use of screen space
4. WHEN navigating on any device THEN the system SHALL provide consistent navigation patterns and accessibility features
5. WHEN loading content on slower connections THEN the system SHALL show progressive loading states and optimize performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an Ops user, I want real-time notifications and status updates, so that I can respond quickly to mission completions and incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Checker completes a mission THEN the system SHALL immediately notify the assigned Ops user with mission details
2. WHEN a bail mobilité approaches its end date THEN the system SHALL automatically send reminder notifications 10 days in advance
3. WHEN an incident is detected THEN the system SHALL alert relevant Ops users with incident details and suggested actions
