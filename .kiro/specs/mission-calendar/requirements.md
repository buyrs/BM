# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a comprehensive calendar interface for Ops and Admin users to visualize all missions (past, current, and upcoming) in a calendar format. The calendar will provide an intuitive way to view mission schedules and enable direct creation of Bail Mobilité (BM) missions from the calendar interface, improving operational efficiency and mission planning capabilities.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on an empty date in the calendar THEN the system SHALL open a BM mission creation form
2. WHEN creating a mission from the calendar THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the selected date as the mission start date
3. WHEN the mission creation form is submitted THEN the system SHALL create the mission and immediately display it on the calendar
4. WHEN creating a mission THEN the system SHALL validate that all required BM mission fields are completed
5. IF mission creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and allow correction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Ops or Admin user, I want to navigate between different time periods in the calendar, so that I can view historical missions and plan future schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using calendar navigation controls THEN the system SHALL allow switching between months and years
2. WHEN navigating to different time periods THEN the system SHALL load and display missions for the selected timeframe
3. WHEN viewing past missions THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate their completed status
4. WHEN viewing future dates THEN the system SHALL show scheduled and pending missions
5. WHEN loading calendar data THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Ops or Admin user, I want to click on missions in the calendar to expand and view detailed information, so that I can quickly access mission details without leaving the calendar interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on a mission in the calendar THEN the system SHALL expand the mission to show detailed information inline or in an overlay
2. WHEN a mission is expanded THEN the system SHALL display all relevant mission data including status, checker assignment, property details, and progress
3. WHEN viewing expanded BM mission details THEN the system SHALL display bail mobilité specific information including contract status and signatures
4. WHEN mission details are expanded THEN the system SHALL provide quick action buttons to edit, assign, or manage the mission
5. WHEN clicking outside the expanded mission or on a close button THEN the system SHALL collapse the mission details back to the calendar view
6. WHEN multiple missions exist on the same day THEN the system SHALL allow expanding each mission independently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an Ops or Admin user, I want the calendar to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the calendar on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout optimized for smaller screens
2. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN the system SHALL support touch gestures for navigation and interaction
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
