# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rebuilding the existing Baux Mobilité management platform using a modernized tech stack while maintaining all current functionality. The rebuild will transition from the current Laravel + Vue.js/Inertia.js architecture to a more traditional server-side rendered approach using Laravel with Blade templates, enhanced with modern CSS frameworks and component libraries.

The platform manages the complete lifecycle of French "Baux Mobilité" (mobility leases) including property inspections, digital checklists, contract management, electronic signatures, and multi-role user management.
